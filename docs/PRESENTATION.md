# AgriSense AI — Executive Presentation

## 🌿 One-Liner

**AgriSense AI turns raw soil and water sensor data into precision farming decisions using machine learning.**

---

## The Problem

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Water waste** | 70% of global freshwater goes to agriculture; 40-60% is wasted through inefficient irrigation |
| **Soil degradation** | 33% of global soils are degraded, costing $400B/year in lost productivity |
| **Uninformed decisions** | Most smallholder farmers rely on intuition, not data |
| **Nutrient overuse** | Excessive fertilization pollutes groundwater and costs farmers money |
| **Climate unpredictability** | Changing weather patterns make traditional farming knowledge unreliable |

## The Solution

AgriSense AI deploys IoT sensors across farmland and uses machine learning to provide:

### 🌱 Soil Intelligence
- Real-time soil health scoring (0-100) across 8 zones
- Automatic detection of N, P, K deficiencies with fertilizer dosage recommendations
- pH imbalance alerts with specific amendment guidance

### 💧 Water Management
- Water quality grading (A-F) from multiple sources (borewell, river, canal, rainwater)
- **34% water savings** through smart, zone-specific irrigation scheduling
- Treatment recommendations when water quality is insufficient

### 🌾 Crop Intelligence
- ML-powered crop recommendations from a 40-crop database
- Yield forecasting with zone-level efficiency tracking
- Season-aware suggestions optimized for local conditions

### 📊 Decision Dashboard
- Premium dark-themed dashboard accessible from any browser
- Real-time alerts for critical conditions requiring immediate action
- At-a-glance KPIs: health scores, water savings, yield efficiency

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Sensor zones** | 8 independent monitoring zones |
| **ML models** | 6 specialized pipelines |
| **Crop database** | 40 crops with ideal condition profiles |
| **Water savings** | 34% reduction vs uniform irrigation |
| **Data points** | 25,000+ sensor readings processed |
| **Dashboard** | 6 tabs, 9 interactive charts, real-time alerts |
